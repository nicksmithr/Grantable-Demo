# Grantable Demo

> This is a Vue.js application, conceptualising "Grantable" -- a project I worked on with Kieran Hammond at Entrepreneur First. The aim of Grantable is to provide an unbiased mechanism for foundations and grantmakers to assess charitable grants.

The demo is available [here](http://demo.grantable.co.uk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/#/).

## About

> The concept uses prediction markets, this demo is a basic front-end powered by a Firebase database. Please get in touch with me at to@nsmith.co if this is something you'd like to discuss more!
